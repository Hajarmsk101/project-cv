        <h2>Career overview</h2>
        <p>
            I have had an incredible journey in my racing career, widely recognized as one of the greatest in
            Formula 1
            history. Born on January 7, 1985, I made my debut in 2007 with McLaren and quickly established myself as
            a
            formidable talent by finishing third in my inaugural season. In 2008, I won my first World Championship,
            becoming the youngest ever at that time. My move to Mercedes in 2013 marked a turning point,
            transforming both
            my career and the sport. I dominated the hybrid era, securing six additional World Championships (2014,
            2015,
            2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020), tying Michael Schumacher's record of seven titles. Known for my exceptional
            skill
            and relentless determination, I also advocate for diversity and environmental issues, extending my
            impact beyond
            the track and making me a global icon and trailblazer in motorsport.

        <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
        <p>My education includes attending The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school
            in
            Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. While at John Henry Newman, I balanced my academic responsibilities
            with my
            burgeoning karting career. From a young age, I dedicated much of my time and energy to racing, which
            paid off as
            I achieved early success in karting. This success paved the way for my entry into higher levels of
            racing,
            eventually leading to my professional career in Formula 1. Although I did not pursue higher education in
            a
            traditional sense, my dedication to motorsport and the practical education I received through racing and
            working
            with various teams have been pivotal to my success. My career trajectory exemplifies how passion,
            talent, and
            dedication can lead to success, even without following a conventional educational path.</p>
